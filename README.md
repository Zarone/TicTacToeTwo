# ‚≠ïÔ∏ètictactoe 2

This monorepo contains the complete source to develop and run tictactoe.
It consists of a react client and a node.js, socket.io backend.

## üíæ Installation

Clone the repository and execute the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Zarone/TicTacToeTwo.git tictactoe
cd tictactoe
yarn install
```

This will install all the required dependencies for both `client` and `server`.

### ‚öôÔ∏èEnvironment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file from the `client/` directory to `client/.env`.
Adjust the variables according to your setup, the defaults will work with this guide.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running

After that you can start the applications using:

```shell
# in project root
yarn dev
```

Or alternatively start client and server independently using:

```shell
# start the frontend:
cd client/
yarn run start

# start the backend/server
cd server/
yarn run start
```

The client is listening on `:3000`. The server is listening on `:3001`.

## üê≥Docker

To run the application using docker you may execute:

```shell
# in repo root directory
docker compose up
```

This will build and execute both `client` and `server` package respectively.
Once docker-compose boots up you can access the application through:

```shell
http://localhost:3000 # frontend
http://localhost:3001 # backend
```

Note: The docker setup is using the production bundle, there is no code reloading or file system mirroring at the moment.

## üß™Testing

This project is using `jest` for automated tests. Both client and server are configured using test.

To run the test suite execute:

```shell
# in project root:
yarn run test

## or individiually:
# in server/
yarn run test
# in client/
yarn run test
```

## üßπFormatting

This project is using `prettier` to keep the code style consistent.
To format the whole codebase execute:

```shell
# in project root:
yarn run format # or: make format
```
